Setup checklist:
    - Change namespace in following files:
        --Project.cs
        --Startup.cs
        --Controller.cs
        --BaseEntity.cs
        --Context.cs
        --Model files
    
    - Change variable names to match Context and Controllers
        --Context in Startup.cs file
        --Controller in Controller.cs file (if you're changing from HomeController)
            **IF you change name of controller, you must also change name of "Home" folder in Views to match**

    - If necessary, change User validations on included RegViewModel

    - Alter wrapper to include necessary models

    - Change ViewData title in Index.cshtml
        --Possibly alter validations depending on RegViewModel

    - Packaged in Controller.cs file, alter as necessary:
        --Login/reg functions in Index view
        --Sample Dashboard view w/ logic to check for logged in user + if logged in, setup wrapper model and set session
